# Contributing to Restify

Welcome to the restify community! This document is written both for maintainers and community members!

## Issues and PRs

We try to keep things organized around here. Maintainers have a finite amount of time and are often juggling multiple things in their lives. Keeping things consistent and well labeled helps reduce the amount of concentration and effort required for us to both find and carry out work on the project. Simple things like using our templates and adding the appropriate labels may only take you a few minutes, but it can save cummulative hours worth of work for maintainers trying to digest dozens of issues.
